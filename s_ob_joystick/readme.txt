s_ob_joystick
=====================
This project contains an example demonstrating the use of the 
Joystick mounted on the OEM Base Board. The state of 
the joystick will be printed to the console.


The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- Lib_CMSIS          : for CMSIS files relevant to LPC408x
- Lib_MCU        	 : for LPC408x peripheral driver files
- Lib_OemBaseBoard   : for Embedded Artists OEM Base Board peripheral drivers


These library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
