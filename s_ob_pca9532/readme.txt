s_ob_pca9532
=====================
This project illustrates the use of the I2C attached
PCA9532 device. On the OEM Base Board a couple of LEDs
and buttons are connected to the PCA9532 device. Press
a button and a LED will turn on.


The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- Lib_CMSIS          : for CMSIS files relevant to LPC408x
- Lib_MCU        	 : for LPC408x peripheral driver files
- Lib_OemBaseBoard   : for Embedded Artists OEM Base Board peripheral drivers


These library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
