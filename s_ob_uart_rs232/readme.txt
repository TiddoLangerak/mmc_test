s_ob_uart_rs232
=====================
This project illustrates the use of UART output on the RS232
port on the OEM Base Board.

Please note that you must change jumper JP6, see section called
UART Multiplexing in the User's manual.


The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- Lib_CMSIS          : for CMSIS files relevant to LPC408x
- Lib_MCU        	 : for LPC408x peripheral driver files


These library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
