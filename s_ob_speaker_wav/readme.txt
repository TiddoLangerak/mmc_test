s_ob_speaker_wav
=====================
This project illustrates the use of the speaker mounted on
the OEM Base Board. The DAC output on the LPC1788 is used.


The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- Lib_CMSIS          : for CMSIS files relevant to LPC408x
- Lib_MCU        	 : for LPC408x peripheral driver files
- Lib_OemBaseBoard   : for Embedded Artists OEM Base Board peripheral drivers


These library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
