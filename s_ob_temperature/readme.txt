s_ob_temperature
=====================
This project illustrates the use of the temperature sensor
(LM75A) mounted the OEM Base Board. The temperature is printed 
in the console. Please note that the value printed is a factor
100 larger than the real temperature



The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- Lib_CMSIS          : for CMSIS files relevant to LPC408x
- Lib_MCU        	 : for LPC408x peripheral driver files
- Lib_OemBaseBoard   : for Embedded Artists OEM Base Board peripheral drivers



These library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
