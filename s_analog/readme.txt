s_analog
=====================
This project contains a an example reading values from
the analog inputs. On the OEM Base Board there is a trim
potentiometer attached to one of the analog channels.
Read values are printed to the console.

The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- Lib_CMSIS          : for CMSIS files relevant to LPC178x
- Lib_MCU        	 : for LPC178x peripheral driver files
- Lib_OemBaseBoard   : for Embedded Artists OEM Base Board peripheral drivers


These library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
