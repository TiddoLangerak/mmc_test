s_ob_accelerometer
=====================
This project contains an example reading values from
the accelerometer (attached to I2C bus) on the OEM Base Board.
The values are printed on the UART.


The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- Lib_CMSIS          : for CMSIS files relevant to LPC408x
- Lib_MCU        	 : for LPC178x peripheral driver files
- Lib_OemBaseBoard       : for Embedded Artists OEM Base Board peripheral drivers
- Lib_OemBoard       : for Embedded Artists OEM Board drivers


These library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
